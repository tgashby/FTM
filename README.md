FTM
======

1. Make a local copy of this repo: `git clone git@github.com:tgashby/FTM.git`.  This gets you the master branch.
2. Switch to the master branch if you aren't on it `git checkout master`
3. Update the master branch to the most recent version: `git pull origin master`
4. Make a local branch for each new feature: `git checkout -b my-feature-branch` (change `my-feature-branch` to the name of your feature or bug fix).
5. Commit your changes to that branch. `git commit -m "Your Message here"`. You can commit multiple times to the same branch.
6. Make sure you have pulled the other changes that have occurred since you originally created your branch. `git pull origin master`.
7. Push your changes to a branch on github: `git push origin my-feature-branch`.
8. Make a pull request when you're ready.  Do this from the Github interface.
9. Someone will review your changes and merge them in.
10. Go back to step 2.
